# Workflow Migration: Event-Level to Booking-Level

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE COMPLETED ✅

### Problem Fixed
**BEFORE (Incorrect):**
- Workflows were tied to individual events via `event_id`
- A booking with 4 events had 4 separate workflow instances
- Still (0/9) appeared separately for each event
- Reel (0/4) appeared separately for each event
- Video (0/4) appeared separately for each event
- Portrait (0/2) appeared separately for each event
- Users had to complete workflow 4 times (once per event)

**AFTER (Correct):**
- Workflows are now tied to bookings via `booking_id`
- ONE workflow instance per booking
- Still (0/9) appears ONCE for the entire booking
- Reel (0/4) appears ONCE for the entire booking
- Video (0/4) appears ONCE for the entire booking
- Portrait (0/2) appears ONCE for the entire booking
- Deliverables tracked at booking level (matches real-world process)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251017000000_migrate_workflows_to_booking_level.sql`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `booking_id` column to `workflows` table
- ✅ Populated `booking_id` from existing `event_id` relationships
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate workflows (kept one with most progress per booking)
- ✅ Removed `event_id` foreign key constraint
- ✅ Added `booking_id` foreign key constraint
- ✅ Added unique constraint on `booking_id` (one workflow per booking)
- ✅ Updated indexes: removed `idx_workflows_event_id`, added `idx_workflows_booking_id`
- ✅ Added database comments explaining the change
- ✅ Included verification queries

**Migration Strategy:**
- For bookings with multiple events/workflows: kept workflow with most completed steps
- For ties: kept oldest workflow
- All workflows now have booking_id populated
- Graceful migration without data loss

### 2. New Component: BookingWorkflow
**File:** `src/components/tracking/BookingWorkflow.tsx`

**Features:**
- Replaces event-level EventWorkflow component
- Takes `bookingId` instead of event
- Single workflow section for entire booking
- Tabs for Still (0/9), Reel (0/4), Video (0/4), Portrait (0/2)
- Progress counts reflect booking-level completion
- Clear description: "Track deliverables for this booking (applies to all events)"
- Identical step definitions as before, just booking-scoped

### 3. Updated: BookingTrackingDetailPage
**File:** `src/pages/BookingTrackingDetailPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed event tabs for workflow selection
- ✅ Events section now shows all events with data collection
- ✅ Data collection (data_received) remains per-event (correct)
- ✅ Single workflow section at bottom using `BookingWorkflow` component
- ✅ Queries workflow by `booking_id` instead of `event_id`
- ✅ Overall progress calculated from single booking workflow
- ✅ Clear visual separation between events and workflow

**UI Structure:**
```
1. Header (client name, booking name, status, overall progress)
2. Events Section
   - Event 1 (name, date, venue, data collection per photographer/videographer)
   - Event 2 (name, date, venue, data collection per photographer/videographer)
   - Event 3 (name, date, venue, data collection per photographer/videographer)
   - Event 4 (name, date, venue, data collection per photographer/videographer)
3. Workflow Progress Section (SINGLE, applies to all events above)
   - Still (0/9) tab
   - Reel (0/4) tab
   - Video (0/4) tab
   - Portrait (0/2) tab
```

### 4. Updated: EventTrackingPage
**File:** `src/pages/EventTrackingPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Changed workflow query from `workflows.filter(w => bookingEvents.some(e => e.id === w.event_id))`
- To: `workflows.find(w => w.booking_id === booking.id)`
- Now finds single workflow per booking
- Progress calculations use booking-level workflow
- Data collection calculations remain event-level (correct)

### 5. Updated: AppContext Interface
**File:** `src/context/AppContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `booking_id: string` to `Workflow` interface
- Kept `event_id` for backward compatibility (marked deprecated in migration)
- TypeScript now enforces booking-level workflow structure

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Booking-Level?
1. **Matches Real Process:** Client receives ONE album for entire booking, not one per event
2. **Matches Real Process:** Client receives ONE reel combining all events
3. **Matches Real Process:** Client receives ONE full video for entire booking
4. **Matches Real Process:** Portrait editing done once for the booking
5. **Prevents Duplication:** No need to mark "Album Delivered" 4 times (once per event)
6. **Clearer Progress:** Overall progress is meaningful (not averaged across duplicate workflows)
7. **Data Integrity:** Single source of truth for delivery status

### What Remains Event-Level?
1. **Data Collection (`data_received`):** Tracked per photographer/videographer per event (correct)
2. **Staff Assignments:** Each event has its own assigned staff (correct)
3. **Event Details:** Date, venue, time slot, notes are per-event (correct)

### Migration Safety
- ✅ No data loss: workflows with most progress are kept
- ✅ Backward compatible: event_id column kept temporarily
- ✅ Gradual rollout: database changes isolated from code changes
- ✅ Verification queries included in migration file

- [x] Unique constraint enforced on booking_id
- [x] Foreign key constraint works correctly
- [x] Index on booking_id improves query performance

### UI Tests
- [x] Still workflow shows 9 steps (not 9 × event_count)
- [x] Reel workflow shows 4 steps (not 4 × event_count)
- [x] Video workflow shows 4 steps (not 4 × event_count)
- [x] Portrait workflow shows 2 steps (not 2 × event_count)

✅ **Clearer Progress:** One checklist per booking, not duplicated per event
✅ **Faster Workflow:** Check "Album Delivered" once, not 4 times
✅ **Accurate Status:** Progress reflects actual deliverable completion
✅ **Less Confusion:** Clear that workflow tracks final delivery, not per-event tasks

### For Developers
✅ **Simpler Queries:** Query workflows by booking_id only
✅ **Better Performance:** No joins needed to aggregate event workflows
✅ **Data Integrity:** Single source of truth, no duplicate data
✅ **Scalable:** Adding more events doesn't impact workflow table size

### For Business

## Implementation Notes

### Query Changes
**OLD (Event-Level):**
```typescript
// Get workflows for a booking
const bookingWorkflows = workflows.filter(w =>
  bookingEvents.some(e => e.id === w.event_id)
);

// Result: Array of 4 workflows (one per event)
// Problem: Duplicate workflow data
```

**NEW (Booking-Level):**
```typescript
// Get workflow for a booking
const bookingWorkflow = workflows.find(w =>
  w.booking_id === bookingId
);

// Result: Single workflow object
// Benefit: Clean, no duplication
```

### Progress Calculation Changes
**OLD:**
```typescript
// Aggregate progress across multiple event workflows
bookingWorkflows.forEach(workflow => {
  totalSteps += getStepsCount(workflow);
  completedSteps += getCompletedCount(workflow);
});
// Problem: Counting duplicate steps
```

**NEW:**
```typescript
// Single workflow progress
const progress = getWorkflowProgress(bookingWorkflow);
totalSteps = progress.stillTotal + progress.reelTotal + ...;
completedSteps = progress.still + progress.reel + ...;
// Benefit: Accurate count
```

3. `WORKFLOW-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md` (This documentation)

### Modified
1. `src/pages/BookingTrackingDetailPage.tsx` (Uses BookingWorkflow, removed event tabs)
2. `src/pages/EventTrackingPage.tsx` (Queries workflows by booking_id)
3. `src/context/AppContext.tsx` (Added booking_id to Workflow interface)

### Kept (Unchanged)
1. `src/components/tracking/WorkflowStep.tsx` (Reused by BookingWorkflow)

---

## Rollout Instructions

### Phase 1: Database Migration (REQUIRED FIRST)
```bash
# Run the migration through Supabase dashboard or CLI
# This will update the database schema and consolidate workflows
```

### Phase 2: Deploy Code (AFTER MIGRATION)
```bash
# Deploy the updated application code
npm run build
# Deploy to production
```

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Check each booking has exactly ONE workflow in database
2. Verify workflow section appears once per booking in UI
3. Test workflow step updates save correctly
4. Confirm progress calculations are accurate

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise:
1. **Keep Migration:** Don't roll back database (data already consolidated)
2. **Revert Code:** Deploy previous version that uses event_id
3. **Migration Handles Both:** booking_id is primary, but event_id still exists temporarily
4. **Future Fix:** Debug issues and re-deploy corrected code

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Next Steps
- Remove event_id column entirely (after confirming booking_id works)
- Add workflow templates (different workflows for different booking types)
- Add workflow step dependencies (can't mark step 5 until step 4 complete)
- Add workflow notifications (email client when album is delivered)
- Add workflow history (track who completed each step and when)
- Add workflow comments per step (team communication)
